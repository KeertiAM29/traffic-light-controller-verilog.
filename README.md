# 🚦 Verilog-Based Traffic Light Controller

A Digital System Design project using Verilog HDL that simulates a two-way traffic signal controller using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and implements it on an FPGA board.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a traffic light controller for a two-way intersection using FSMs in Verilog HDL and simulate its working using testbenches.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project replicates a basic traffic light system using four FSM states. It simulates LED behavior for North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions with specific timing for Green and Yellow lights.

### 🔋 Key Features:
- 🚥 4 FSM states controlling traffic flow
- 🕒 Timed transitions using clock division
- 🧪 Verilog testbench simulation
- ⛓ FPGA implementation using UCF constraints
- ✅ Verified functionality via synthesis and timing reports
